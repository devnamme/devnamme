## Hello hackerman! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Emman. I'm a Software Developer at Samsung Research & Development Institute Philippines. Prior to joining Samsung, I served as the Design Executive Editor of the official student publication of Ateneo de Manila University where I redeveloped its three major websites and launched the entire digitization of the publication.

Wanna see all my past projects and published work? Come take a look at my [personal portfolio](https://emmanevangelista.com)!

Got a project idea, or perhaps you just want to connect? You can find me here:
